## MTG Cascade Simulator for Laelia, the Blade Reforged deck

Calculate cascade specific stats (avg number of cards hit) and simulate cascades. Built for Laelia specifically, but might be useful for other commanders too I guess? Idk

## MTG Deck Primer

A simple site that generates deck primers, as an image that can be printed out in card size to go in the front of commander decks. 

Displays information such as the following:

- The deck name
- The commander
- The bracket
- How many and which gamechangers, tutors etc
- How many basics/total lands
- A QR code linking to the deck on monxfield.
